What is Docker? Building, running and shipping apps.

Container: Isolated Environment

Virtual Machine vs Containers

C: An isolated environment for running an application
VM: Abstraction of a machine using HyperVisors

Docker has a client component that uses a Rest API that connects to the Docker Engine

Kernel: Core of an OS, manages all apps and hardware resources

Commands:

apt update
apt install {package name} //nano, less

echo
mkdir
cd
ls
rm
mv

ls bin //shows commands
